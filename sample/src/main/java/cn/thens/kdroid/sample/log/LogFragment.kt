In English grammar, articles are frequently considered part of a broader category called determiners, which contains articles, demonstratives (such as \"this\" and \"that\"), possessive determiners (such as \"my\" and \"his\"), and quantifiers (such as \"all\" and \"few\").[1] Articles and other determiners are also sometimes counted as a type of adjective, since they describe the words that they precede.

Articles may also be modified as influenced by adjacent sounds or words as in elision (e.g., French \"le\" becoming \"l'\" before a vowel), epenthesis (e.g., English \"a\" becoming \"an\" before a vowel), or contraction (e.g. Irish \"i + na\" becoming \"sna\")."
